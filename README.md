# DTEP Group 2 Project - Touchless Button Pannel
## 1. The Design Problem

We argue that the pandemic did not just expose us to a virus, it exposed vulnerabilities in how we interact with and share public spaces. Tasks we once considered mundane, like using an elevator, vending machine, or ATM, became sources of anxiety and discomfort for some. Through research and our own interviews, we found that people are now far more aware of germs and hygiene than they ever were before the pandemic. This heightened awareness inspired our project, driven by a simple but powerful observation: the less we touch, the safer we feel.

##2. The solution 

Our design is a touchless number panel for elevators and door code machines, aimed at minimizing physical contact with surfaces in public spaces to enhance both hygiene and convenience. It operates using infrared transmitters and a receiver that detects the number being pointed at. What sets our design apart is not just the touch-free interaction but also the added features, such as two types of immediate feedback to confirm each selection, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
We believe the true value of our product lies both in its scalability and its suitability for the context it was designed for. Our research identified a pressing need for hygienic, contactless interaction, a problem our design successfully resolves.

## 3. The process 

The initial stage of our prototyping process focused on testing the infrared sensors. Our goal was to address several key questions, such as determining the optimal distance for pointing, the ideal proximity between the receiver and transmitter, and how to effectively distinguish which transmitter was being targeted.

Next, we shifted our attention to the aesthetic and structural elements of the prototype. With 3D modeling, we created and printed several design variations. After evaluating these options, we selected the most suitable candidate for the final prototype, balancing both form and function.

In the third stage, we focused on integrating all the components, including two types of feedback mechanisms. Initially, our plan was to incorporate an LED ring surrounding the panel. However, due to the high cost and limited availability of such a LED ring, we opted to creating a custom solution using eight LEDs and a shifter multiplexer. 

The final step involved soldering all the cables and components together and assembling everything into the 3D-printed housing. This stage brought all the elements together to create the final prototype, ready for presentation and testing!
